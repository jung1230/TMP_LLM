Section 2 - Project Description
I sent an updated WZIA to Chris for this project. That needs to be updated prior to 60% approval.

Ok, just saw that it was attached below. Please move it to this section.
Section 4 - Work Zone Strategies
As you get further with the estimate on this project please add cost information to this table. You should have the costs for the temp pedestrian accommodations along with the traffic control costs.

I would think you would have additional cost info to add here
Section 6 - Traffic Analysis
For flagging operations you can use a capacity of 600 vphpl. For single lane closures in a signalized corridor (assuming multi lane roadway) you would use 900 vphpl.

Once details for the temp ped accommodations are put together the impact to the roadway will be clearer and we should be able to look at each intersection and determine what the specific time restrictions, if any, are needed.
Section 8 - Incident Management Strategies
Standard RIMC process
Section 9 - Staging Plans
In your staging summary you list out 10' travel lanes, we have a minimum 11' travel lane. I also don't want to say that the contractor is responsible to developing the traffic control plan. That is our responsibility. If you want to refer to SDD's and list hour restrictions that is fine. I would prefer we show a plan sheet for each intersection that shows both the temp ped accommodations along with roadway traffic control.

As stated in the plan review, we should have details at each intersection for the curb ramp work, I don't think an SDD is adequate as not all locations have a grid or adjacent crossings as an option. We are better off dealing with this now in design vs trying to deal with it in construction when we really have no way of adjusting. This leads to non ADA compliant accommodations.

Attach flagging sheet as well
