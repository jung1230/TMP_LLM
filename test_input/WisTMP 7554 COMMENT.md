# **Section 2 - Project Description**

## **Brief description of work activities:**

This project involves reconstructing pedestrian curb ramps at 23 different intersections throughout Sauk County to meet ADA standards. Specific locations are shown in the attached project location maps and include intersections in the following three communities: 14 intersections along WIS 23 and WIS 33 in Reedsburg, 3 intersections along WIS 154 in Rock Springs, 6 intersections along WIS 33, WIS 113, and WIS 136 in Baraboo. A work zone impact assessment was conducted and is summarized in the attached documents. The curb ramp reconstruction work will be completed under a mix of staging/traffic control options including short term travel lane closures, turn lane closures, shoulder closures, private driveway closures, single travel lane with flagging operations, and/or parking restrictions (see Section 9 on this TMP). Travel lane closures are limited to non-peak hours only (weekdays 9:00am to 3:00pm). Pedestrians will be accommodated using signed detours, temporary crossings, or temporary at-corner sidewalk. Work at the 23 project intersections is scheduled for 2020 (September 4 - November 2). Additional locations will be reconstructed in 2021 as part of a separate project. A separate TMP will be prepared for the 2021 project.

Cost of chosen strategies (sum of strategy costs): \$7300

## **Section 5 - Work Zone Impacts**

## **Describe how access to traffic generators (businesses, schools, etc.) and everyday services will be maintained:**

Public street traffic will be maintained in both directions within all active work areas. Some private driveways may be closed for up to 7 calendar days, if alternate site access is available. If no alternate access is available, a single travel lane with flagging operations will be used to maintain traffic at the impacted private driveway. Current correspondence with impacted groups includes minutes from the Local Officials Meetings (LOM) and Public Involvement Meetings (PIM) held in February 2020, which are attached in this section.

## **Describe how impacts to bicycle riders will be mitigated/coordinated:**

There are currently no dedicated bicycle facilities within the project limits. Bicyclists may travel through work zones using the available travel lane(s) or use alternate local routes.

## **Are there anticipated traffic impacts from the proposed project on other road/routes in the region/corridor?**

The project is not expected to result in traffic impacts to other roads/routes.

#### **Does the project affect other regions/states?**

No

## **List holidays or major special events that occur during the project:**

| Holiday/Special Event                             | Begin Date | End Date   |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|
| Labor Day                                         | 09/04/2020 | 09/08/2020 |
| Reedsburg High School Homecoming Parade           | 09/18/2020 | 09/18/2020 |
| Rogues and Ruffians (Circus World Museum Grounds) | 10/09/2020 | 10/12/2020 |

## **How will traffic disruptions be minimized during listed events and holidays?**

For the work occurring in 2020 (September 4 - November 2) no lane closures, work activities, or material hauling is permitted along any area roadways during the Labor Day holiday noted above. The Reedsburg High School Homecoming Parade will be held on September 18, 2020. All sidewalk and curb ramps at the WIS 23/K Street, WIS 23/Franklin Street, and WIS 33 /Albert Street intersections must be open to pedestrians on this date. The Rogues and Ruffians event at the Circus World Museum grounds will be held October 10-11, 2020. All sidewalk and curb ramps at the Broadway Street/Water Street intersection must be open to pedestrians October 9 through 6:00 am October 12. Ongoing coordination with local officials is

expected before and during construction to identify any additional special events and determine if traffic mitigation measures are needed. Holiday/special event restrictions are also expected for the work occurring in 2021 which; will be documented in a separate TMP for that project.

## **How was the work zone capacity determined?**

WisDOT Southwest Region estimates capacities of 600 vehicles per hour per lane (vphpl) for flagging operations and 900 vphpl for single-lane closures along a signalized corridor. Mainline travel lane closures and single-lane with flagging operations are limited to non-peak hours only and turn lane/shoulder/parking lane restrictions are not expected to significantly impact through travel operations. Therefore minimal delay is anticipated with the project.

## **Section 6+ - Lane Closure Hours**

**a) Are there restrictions on when lane closures are allowed?** Yes

## **b) What hours/days are lane closures permitted?**

Single lane closures (2 thru lanes reduced to 1) and single travel lane with flagging operations may be used during nonpeak hours at select locations (see Section 9). Non-peak hours were considered to be weekdays from 9:00 am to 3:00 pm, but may be adjusted by the construction engineer.

## **c) If the project is reporting zero delay, show the delay incurred if the lane closures hours identified are not followed:**

Some delay will occur with the proposed lane closures and flagging operations but it is expected to be minimal. Mainline travel lane closures are limited to non-peak hours only.

## **Section 6+ - Detour Route**

**Detour Information**

|  | Detour Route | Normal Travel Time (min) | Detour Travel Time (min) | Detour Distance (mi) |
|--|--------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
|--|--------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|

## **Section 6+ - Intersection/Temporary Signal**

**If existing signals are impacted by the project, will there be any changes? If so, please describe any changes that will be made to the signals. If using temporary signals for one-lane two-way operations, how will the signals be timed? In either case, were pedestrian movements considered?**

No temporary or permanent traffic control changes are proposed.

# **Section 9 - Staging Plans**

## **Briefly describe the staging planned for maintaining traffic:**

Traffic control notes and construction details are provided in the design plans to document work zone traffic control and pedestrian accommodations at each project intersection. Restrictions to sidewalk, parking lanes, right-turn lanes, shoulders, and travel lanes are expected. Reduced lane widths will also be used in active work areas. A summary of recommended mainline traffic control strategies is provided below. More detailed information on mainline and side street traffic control strategies is provided within the design plans and the attached traffic control summary table. Flagging operations shall follow the corresponding WisDOT standard detail drawings (attached). Specific roadway staging will be dependent on contractor operations and as approved by the construction engineer. Work at any specific intersection is expected to last up to 14 days. -Reedsburg: *WIS 23 (Southridge Blvd to Main St) and WIS 33 (Alexander Ave to Albert Ave): Right-turn lane, shoulder, and parking lane closures (allowed anytime). *WIS 33 (Albert Ave to Golf Course Rd): Parking lane and right-turn lane closures (allowed anytime); outside lane closures (allowed during non-peak hours only); work limited to every other intersection and

one side at a time to allow for pedestrian detours. -Rock Springs: *WIS 154/WIS 136: Right-turn lane, shoulder, and parking lane closures (allowed anytime); single travel lane with flagging operations (allowed during non-peak hours only). -Baraboo *WIS 113: Right-turn lane, shoulder, and parking lane closures (allowed anytime) *WIS 136: Parking lane and right-turn lane closures (allowed anytime); outside lane closures (allowed during non-peak hours only); work limited to every other intersection and one side at a time to allow for pedestrian detours.

#### **Describe how pedestrians will be accommodated during construction.**

Crossings and ramps will be closed (for up to 14 days) at project intersections when work is active at that location. Pedestrians will be accommodated using signed detours, temporary crossings, or temporary at-corner sidewalk. Construction details of these treatments are attached. When a pedestrian detour is used, curb ramp work may not occur at two adjacent intersections simultaneously in order to maintain viable alternate pedestrian routes. Recommended temporary treatments for each intersection are provided in the design plans.
