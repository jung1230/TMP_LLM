**Queueing when:**

| Strategy                                        | Justification/Comment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Cost     |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| Shoulder<br>Closure                             | Any work that does not require a travel lane closure will be allowed to be completed under<br>shoulder closures. Expected operations include shouldering, guardrail installation, guardrail<br>grading, culvert pipe work, curb and gutter replacement, select pavement marking, and<br>restoration items. Costs mainly consist of drums, signing, and personnel.             | \$20000  |
| Night work                                      | Intersections on the detour route are unable to accommodate large trucks (WB-62) without<br>encroaching into opposite travel lanes. To reduce the amount of traffic using the detour route<br>and better allow large trucks to use opposing lanes at intersections the work will be completed<br>between 6PM-6AM. Cost is from higher unit prices expected due to night work. | \$190000 |
| Lane Rental                                     | A lane rental fee will be administered for impacts to the travel lanes outside of nightwork<br>hours. Lane rental fees will be charged at \$200 per hour for each stage and detour.                                                                                                                                                                                           | \$0      |
| Rapid Cure<br>Materials                         | Special high early strength (SHES) concrete will be used for base patching nightwork. It's<br>estimated that unit price for concrete base will increase by \$60-\$80/SY for SHES.                                                                                                                                                                                             | \$85000  |
| Detour<br>Route                                 | A detour route will be in place for nightwork when the roadway is closed. Costs include detour<br>signs, barricades, drums, mobilizations, detour pavement marking, and detour shoulder<br>aggregate.                                                                                                                                                                         | \$105000 |
| Work hour<br>restrictions<br>for peak<br>travel | Based on traffic counts from site 150470 (Bayview Bridge) AADT is at or exceeds 600 veh/hr<br>from 6AM-6PM. It is also expected that the majority of large truck traffic will occur within this<br>timeframe. Night closures will not be allowed on Fridays or Saturday due to work zone safety<br>concerns(impaired drivers) and events.                                     | \$0      |
| Temporary<br>Traffic<br>Control<br>Signs             | Signs to inform public of road work and closures.                                                                                             | \$10000 |
| Portable<br>Changeable<br>Message<br>Signs<br>(PCMS) | Prior to the beginning of project, prior to nighttime roadway closures, and prior to changing<br>intersection access of Gordon Rd (County BB) | \$10000 |

Cost of chosen strategies (sum of strategy costs): \$420000

# **Section 5 - Work Zone Impacts**

### **Describe how access to traffic generators (businesses, schools, etc.) and everyday services will be maintained:**

Access to to traffic generators will be maintained at all times. The roadway will remain open to traffic during daytime hours. Affected properties will be informed of the nightwork closures and local access will continue to be maintained within the closure.

## **Are there anticipated traffic impacts from the proposed project on other road/routes in the region/corridor?**

Due to STH 42 closures and detours occurring at night when traffic counts are negligible, no impacts to detour routes are expected.

## **Does the project affect other regions/states?**

No.

## **List holidays or major special events that occur during the project:**

| Holiday/Special Event | Begin Date | End Date   |
|-----------------------|------------|------------|
| Memorial Day          | 05/26/2023 | 05/30/2023 |
| Independence Day      | 06/30/2023 | 07/10/2023 |

## **How will traffic disruptions be minimized during listed events and holidays?**

The contractor will not be allowed to perform work on, nor haul materials of any kind along or across any portion of the highway carrying STH 42 traffic. The contractor will need to entirely clear the traveled way and shoulders of STH 42 from equipment, barricades, signs, lights, and any other material that might impede the free flow of traffic.

## **Section 6 - Traffic Analysis**

## **What is the anticipated travel delay during the project for each impacted roadway?**

| # | Location Description                                         | WZ Capacity<br>(vphpl) | Delay<br>(min) | Queue<br>(mi) | Delay Cause                 |
|---|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| 1 | WIS 42 NB from EGG HARBOR RD to WIS 42N (END<br>DIVIDED)     | 1400                   | 14             | 0.01          | Full closure with<br>detour |
| 2 | WIS 42 SB from WIS 42 SB (BEGIN DIVIDED) to<br>EGG HARBOR RD | 1400                   | 14             | 0.01          | Full closure with<br>detour |

## **How was the work zone capacity determined?**

During daytime hours the roadway will reman open to traffic. Nighttime closures will have a detour in place that will delay travel times but not include a queue.

## **Section 6+ - Lane Closure Hours**

#### **a) Are there restrictions on when lane closures are allowed?** Yes

#### **b) What hours/days are lane closures permitted?**

Closures will be allowed from 6PM to 6AM, Sunday through Thursday nights. Lane rental fees will be assessed at \$200 per hour. Calculations for the lane rental fees can be seen in the attached Work Zone Impact Assessment.

#### **c) If the project is reporting zero delay, show the delay incurred if the lane closures hours identified are not followed:**

n/a

#### **Section 6+ - Detour Route**

#### **Detour Information**

|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|
| Detour A: CTH BB and CTH HH                        | 1                           | 14                          | 10.0                    |

#### **Section 6+ - Intersection/Temporary Signal**

**If existing signals are impacted by the project, will there be any changes? If so, please describe any changes that will be made to the signals. If using temporary signals for one-lane two-way operations, how will the signals be timed? In either case, were pedestrian movements considered?**

None proposed.

#### **Section 6+ - Road User Costs What are the road user costs for the project?**

Road user costs for the project: \$28,800. Lane rental fees: \$200/Hr. See work zone impact analysis.
